# ShortestPathFinder
A dynamic web application built using React.js to visualize the shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall) on a grid. Users can interact with the grid, select nodes, edges, and compute the shortest path between selected nodes. The application provides a clear and intuitive visual representation of the shortest path in red, and supports multiple algorithm selection.

Features
Interactive Grid: Users can click on grid cells to create nodes.
Node and Edge Management: Create and remove nodes and define weighted edges between them.
Shortest Path Algorithms: Supports Dijkstra's Algorithm and Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to find the shortest path between two selected nodes.
Path Visualization: The shortest path is visualized on the grid with red-colored edges.
Responsive Design: The application adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
State Management: React State
Styling: Custom CSS for grid and node designs
Algorithms: Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms implemented in JavaScript
Installation
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shortest-path-visualizer.git
cd shortest-path-visualizer
Installation
Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

npm install
Start the Application
npm run dev
This will start the development server.
Open http://localhost:5173 to view the app in your browser.

Usage
Grid Interaction: Click on the grid to create nodes.
Define Edges: Click between nodes to define weighted edges.
Select Algorithm: Choose between Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall from the dropdown.
Find Shortest Path: Select the source and destination nodes, then click "Find Path" to visualize the shortest path.
How It Works
1. Grid Layout
The grid consists of 16 rows and 30 columns.
Click any cell to add a node. Each node is uniquely identified by its number.
2. Node and Edge Management
Click on a node to view its number.
Create edges by clicking between nodes. The weight of each edge is visually represented on the grid.
3. Shortest Path Algorithms
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Calculates the shortest path from a source node to a destination node by iteratively updating the shortest known distance to each node.
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Computes the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, enabling comprehensive pathfinding across the grid.
4. Path Visualization
Once the shortest path is found, it is visually highlighted in red on the grid for easy identification.
Future Improvements
Dynamic Node Creation: Allow dynamic creation and removal of nodes through user input.
Algorithm Optimization: Implement additional algorithms like A* for more efficient pathfinding.
Graph Export: Enable saving and sharing of graph configurations.
